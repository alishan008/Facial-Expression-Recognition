# Facial-Expression-Recognition

Building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). OpenCV is used to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them. Once trained, saved, and exported the CNN, it directly serves the trained model to a web interface (Flask app) and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.
